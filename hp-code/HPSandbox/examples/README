README: HPSandbox example programs
Last Updated:  May 29, 2007

Included are two example programs to illustrate the use of the HPSandbox objects

*** enumerate.py ***

usage:  enumerate.py <configfile>
Try:    enumerate.py enumerate.conf

This program will read in an HP chain specified in the configure file,
and perform a full enumeration of conformational space.

The problem tablulates:
    1) the density of states (in energies/contacts)
    2) the number density of unique contact states, i.e. disjoint collections
       of microscopic conformations all sharing a unique set of interresidue contacts. 

These values are printed as output.



*** mcrex.py ***

usage:  mcrex.py <configfile>
Try:    mcrex.py mcrex.conf

This program will read in an HP chain and run parameters specified in the configure file,
and perform a replica exchange Monte Carlo simulation.

For the example "mcrex.conf", an 11-mer sequence is simulated, and the program ends when
the native conformation (contact state) is found.
A directory of results is output to directory ./mcrex_data


*** IMPORTANT SETUP NOTES!!! ***

In order to get these example scripts to work correctly, you need to set up the following:

1) The HPSandbox directory (i.e python module) must be defined in your PYTHONPATH environment variable
2) The mcrex.conf file needs to be changed to reflect the absolute pathname of the sequences/clist/hp**  direectory
   containing flat files listing native contact states for each foldable sequence.
