Title: Enumerating Designing Sequences in the HP Model

Journal: Submitted to Journal of Biological Physics


DEPOSIT INFORMATION

Description: This is a tarball containing all the designing sequences
             and their ground states for the HP model for 4 <= N <= 25
             in a plain text format.

Total No. of Files: One tar/gzip archive.

Filenames: HP_designing.tar.gz, containing files named HPnXX.txt

Filetypes: Each HPnXX.txt file contains all designable conformations
           and designing sequence for N = 'XX'. Each line either contains
           a conformation described by N-1 of the letters 'UDRL', or a
           sequence that designs the preceeding conformations. Lines
           with sequences begin with two spaces, followed by a sequence
           specified by N letters ('H' or 'P'), followed by a single
           space and finally the ground state energy as a decimal number.
           All conformations start with U and the first turn is to the
           right.

Special Instructions: The C/C++ programs used to generate the files, as
                      well as some programs used to analyze the data are
                      available upon request.
